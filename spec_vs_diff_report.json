  "summary": "The diff modifies ProfilePage.tsx to add an Admin Dashboard button/badge for admin users, and App.tsx is described as having admin route guards. The file-diff shows the Profile page changes and a summary of App.tsx with admin guards. However, the actual diff content for App.tsx is not shown directly — only its summary in frontend-file-summaries.txt. Based on available evidence, REQ-21 is largely implemented (admin button on profile page, conditional on isAdmin). REQ-22 implementation in App.tsx is only described in the summary file but not shown in raw diff, making it harder to fully verify all AC points.",

      "requirement": "Ensure the admin route guard in App.tsx correctly checks the isAdmin flag from AuthContext and redirects unauthenticated or non-admin users away from all /admin/* routes. Verify the admin flag is set to true when the user with Secret Username SHUBOWNER2026 is logged in.",
      "reason": "The actual App.tsx diff content is not shown — only a summary description in frontend-file-summaries.txt. The summary describes admin guards exist but does not confirm: (1) isAdmin is set to true specifically when secretUsername matches SHUBOWNER2026 in AuthContext, (2) all /admin/* sub-routes are individually protected, (3) navigation links within admin dashboard to all sub-pages are present. The AuthContext file itself is not modified in this diff.",
